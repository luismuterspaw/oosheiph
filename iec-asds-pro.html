So before I'm completely bogged down by exam study I thought I'd run a small online study on abortion. I have done many statistics and methodology units in my degree so I should be able to statistically analyse the data as well to test the hypothesis. Thing is I'm having trouble thinking of research ideas and research questions. So far my ideas relate to personality traits and political stance. The study would not have enough participants to look at something like age as a factor likely. 23 –æ–∫—Ç 2017  –ë–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫—É—é –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—é ACDSee –¥–ª—è –ª—é–±–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞. –õ—É—á—à–∞—è —É—Ç–∏–ª–∏—Ç–∞ –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã —Å –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ ACDSee. 
I'm looking to move there in 2021 to get my degree and I was wondering if there's a pro-natalist culture there and if so, how pervasive is it. I know the city is crazy expensive to live in (I mean, damn, I was looking at the rent prices and holy shite) so maybe the pro-child culture isn't that strong.

I really enjoy the sciences. Some I like more than others, but I still generally tend to find anything science related really interesting. I enjoy reading about science, and science news. When I was in college I wasn‚Äôt really in the best place mentally, and basically wound up throwing away every chance I had at going to and completing college. I wish I had the resources now to go back to school and study something sciencey. My town has a lot of science related companies and schools, so there.

I've had a few friends with aspergers who I've gotten along well with, but I feel like for the most part dropping me in with a bunch of aspies is like a drop of water in hot oil. Especially if we start talking about autism advocacy. It all starts off good with us agreeing that Autism Speaks is a morally questionable organization, but then I mention that I do research on autism intervention and suddenly everyone's like "Autism research is evil!

REPOST FROM A WEEK AGO ! So far you guys have helped me earn nearly 0 in my moving out sale and I'm just so thankful. I still hope I can get some money for the rest of my stuff so I can put it toward some more of my bills. In regards to the boxes , I'm still trying to get them picked up local. If I can't and you want them cut down and shipped to you, if you can pay for shipping, let me know. Still not confirming trades ;) UPDATE Paid off my tuition Sometimes I come across a simple piece of information that was apparently obvious to everyone else but was a key bit of info for me. Just now in /r/lifeprotips I saw "use someone's name when you're thanking them to make it more sincere" and I was like, dude, I need to try that. A couple years ago, I learned in an EMT class that if the patient looks up at you when you enter the room, that indicates they are alert and have a normal mental status. Where if they don't acknowledge you until He has his fingers on asd instead of qwe, he needs to change his keybinds to qwe or it will fuck his reaction time, despite him being fast with the keyboard. You KNOW for a fact that if there was a trading system there would be 3rd party sites advertising weapon variants for money "Bal-27 Inferno 0" and kids would buy it. SHG Doesn't want that to happen anymore than they would want to sell variants themselves in fear of making the game "Pay to Win" and losing the community. As much as they probably want to suck your wallets dry the integrity of the game is at stake. 
First off, I want to just say that my methods aren't foolproof or without fault. What I would like is to generate a discussion with all of you wonderful like-minded people about what I'm doing well, and what I could do better. So first off, here ( is my "Music" folder on the iPad. The two most crucial apps for my practice, and the most crucial for teaching however are contained in the dock ( My practice flow is governed by working. Thought it would be a cool idea to document the initiatives of each EU country with regard ASD in the workplace. Reasoning behind this is fairly simple: you are much more likely to get a job in certain countries as opposed to others and have better supports when you do. Figured I'd kick it off with Ireland. #HAPPY SATURDAY DEPLORABLES! This is u/ivaginaryfriend here and I'm back with all things dank & spicy from the past week!

Climbing out of gutter SR has its own wacky rules and challenges. I'll share the tips and tricks I found and utilized to get outta the basement of SR. Your mileage may vary. Instead of a novel format I'm going to put some bullets. it's gonna be a bit rambling but I think this section of the player base is treated a bit poorly and told to just "get gud." I hope this is a bit more specific although every tip is not for every player. If this helps anyone. Lurker, first time poster. Made a new account because my husband reddits and knows my other handle. Sorry if this needs a flair. I'm on mobile and it won't let me. I had depression before I got pregnant. It hadn't gotten bad in a few years though. Not since I left my previous, abusive home situation with my parents. I was fine, I thought.

I'm more of an introvert and I have social anxiety; I also suffer chronic fatigue. Many times, especially after having a busy week socially -I'm mentally burned out and just want to be left alone and keep to myself.

I have finished reading the book PEO Solution by Brian Peskin and Robert Rowen, M.D. The argument advanced is that EPA/DHA are deleterious at doses commonly used by consumers and that the plant-sourced oils alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) and linoleic acid (omega-6) offer tremendous health benefits, including clarity of mind and ability to focus. tl;dr - I want someone with more expertise to respond to the following claims made in the book. 1.
